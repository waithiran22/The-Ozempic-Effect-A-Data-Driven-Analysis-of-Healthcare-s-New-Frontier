# The Ozempic Effect: A Data-Driven Analysis of Healthcare’s New Frontier

##  Overview  
This project investigates the economic and healthcare disruption caused by GLP-1 agonists (Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus, Trulicity, Mounjaro, Zepbound).  
Using company financials, CMS/CDC data, FDA approvals, and global forecasts, we analyze:  

- Pharma dependency on GLP-1 revenues  
- Medicare spending growth and prescriber adoption  
- Diabetes prevalence (18+ adults vs 67+ seniors)  
- Future outlook (patent expiries, market forecasts, consumer demand)  
- Potential healthcare cost offsets from reduced obesity burden

##  Data Sources  
- **Novo Nordisk Annual Reports (2017–2024)**  
- **Eli Lilly Annual Reports (2020–2024)**  
- **CMS Part D Spending Dashboard (2016–2023)**  
- **CMS Prescriber PUF**  
- **CMS Formulary Reference File**  
- **CDC Diabetes Prevalence (18+, 67+)**  
- **FDA Approvals & Shortages (2017–2025)**  
- **KFF / Ipsos / Pew Consumer Surveys (2023–2024)**  
- **OECD & RAND Obesity Cost Studies**

## Methods  
1. **Data Preparation** → Python (Pandas, NumPy, SQL for CMS).  
2. **Exploratory Analysis** → revenue growth, Medicare spend, prevalence trends.  
3. **Forecasting** → statsmodels/Prophet for 2030 scenarios.  
4. **Geographic Insights** → prescriber adoption maps (geopandas/plotly).  
5. **Scenario Modeling** → base vs aggressive vs conservative growth.  
6. **Health Economics** → GLP-1 cost vs avoided obesity burden.

## Planned Visualizations  
- Company: GLP-1 revenue growth (% of sales, 2017–2024).  
- Medicare: Spending trends & top 10 drug costs.  
- Population: Diabetes prevalence (18+ vs 67+) vs Medicare spend.  
- Geographic: Prescriber density heatmaps.  
- Future Outlook: Patent cliffs, market forecasts to 2030.  
- Consumer & Policy: FDA approvals, shortages, survey adoption.  
- Health Outcomes: Cost of therapy vs potential savings.  

---

##  Deliverables  
- Interactive **Plotly charts** (Jupyter/HTML).  
- Forecast models (Medicare spend & revenues to 2030).  
- Scenario modeling (base, aggressive, conservative).  
- **Final report (PDF)** with visuals & insights.  
- Optional **Shiny dashboard** for interactive exploration.  

---

## Key Questions  
- How much of Novo & Lilly’s revenue depends on GLP-1s?  
- What is the cost burden on Medicare Part D?  
- How does diabetes prevalence drive demand?  
- When do patents expire, and what does that mean for disruption?  
- How large could the GLP-1 market grow by 2030?  
- Can GLP-1 adoption offset U.S. healthcare costs?  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Statsmodels, Prophet, Geopandas  
- **SQL:** For large CMS prescriber/spending queries  
- **R (optional):** Shiny for interactive dashboard  
- **GitHub:** Version control & portfolio publishing
