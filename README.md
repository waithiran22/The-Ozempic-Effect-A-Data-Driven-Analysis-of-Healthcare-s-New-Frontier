# The Ozempic Effect: A Data-Driven Analysis of Healthcare's New Frontier

## Overview
This project investigates the disruption caused by GLP-1 agonists (Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus, Trulicity, Mounjaro, and Zepbound) across healthcare, economics, and consumer behavior. It quantifies the impact of these drugs on pharmaceutical revenues, Medicare Part D spending, diabetes prevalence, and the future outlook of obesity care.

This repository contains the full analytical workflow, cleaned datasets, code, and visualizations necessary to reproduce the analysis.

## Project Objectives
1. Quantify how much of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly‚Äôs revenue depends on GLP-1 drugs.
2. Measure Medicare Part D‚Äôs cost burden for GLP-1s.
3. Track diabetes prevalence among U.S. adults and seniors.
4. Forecast future spending, revenue, and market expansion through 2030.
5. Evaluate potential healthcare cost offsets from GLP-1 adoption.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Data Preparation
- Extract product-level revenues from annual reports.
- Clean and normalize Medicare Part D spending data.
- Match drug names using the Formulary Reference File.
- Merge CDC diabetes prevalence datasets.
- Export all cleaned datasets to `data/processed/`.

### Step 2: Core Analysis
- Calculate GLP-1 share of company revenue.
- Trend Medicare spending per beneficiary and per dosage unit.
- Overlay CDC diabetes trends with Medicare spending growth.

### Step 3: Extended Analysis
- Geographic insights: visualize GLP-1 spending vs diabetes prevalence by state.
- Predictive modeling: project spending and revenue to 2030.
- Health outcomes modeling: estimate potential obesity cost offsets.

### Step 4: Visualization
- Revenue share and product trends (Novo vs Lilly).
- Medicare spending and top GLP-1 drugs.
- Diabetes prevalence (18+ vs 67+).
- Patent expiry and market forecast timelines.
- Cost offsets: healthcare savings waterfall chart.

### Step 5: Deliverables
- Clean datasets (`data/processed/`)
- Interactive visualizations (`reports/figures/`)
- Forecast and regression notebooks (`notebooks/`)
- Final policy and industry report (`reports/ozempic_effect.pdf`)
- Optional dashboard app (`dashboard/`)
